# CoachAI-Projects

## Overview
This repo contains official implementations of **Coach AI Badminton Project** from [Advanced Database System Laboratory, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://sites.google.com/view/nycu-adsl) supervised by [Prof. Wen-Chih Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/wcpeng/).

The high-level concepts of each project are as follows:
1. [Visualization Platform](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/Visualization%20Platform) published at *Physical Education Journal 2020* aims to construct a platform that can be used to illustrate the data from matches.
2. [Shot Influence and Extension Work](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/Shot%20Influence) published at *ICDM-21* and *ACM TIST 2022*, respectively introduce a framework with a shot encoder, a pattern extractor, and a rally encoder to capture long short-term dependencies for evaluating players' performance of each shot. 
3. [Stroke Forecasting](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/Stroke%20Forecasting) published at *AAAI-22* proposes the first stroke forecasting task to predict the future strokes of both players based on the given strokes by ShuttleNet, a position-aware fusion of rally progress and player styles framework.
4. [Strategic Environment](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/Strategic%20Environment) published at *AAAI-23 Student Abstract* designs a safe and reproducible badminton environment for turn-based sports, which simulates rallies with different angles of view and designs the states, actions, and training procedures.
5. [Movement Forecasting](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/Movement%20Forecasting) published at *AAAI-23* proposes the first movement forecasting task, which contains not only the goal of stroke forecasting but also the movement of players, by DyMF, a novel dynamic graphs and hierarchical fusion model based on the proposed player movements (PM) graphs.
6. [CoachAI-Challenge-IJCAI2023](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/CoachAI-Challenge-IJCAI2023) is a badminton challenge (CC4) hosted at *IJCAI-23*. Please find the [website](https://sites.google.com/view/coachai-challenge-2023/) for more details.
7. [ShuttleSet](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/ShuttleSet) published at *KDD-23* is the largest badminton singles dataset with stroke-level records.
    - An extension dataset [ShuttleSet22](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/CoachAI-Challenge-IJCAI2023/ShuttleSet22) published at *IJCAI-24 Demo & IJCAI-23 IT4PSS Workshop* is also released.
8. [CoachAI Badminton Environment](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/CoachAI%20Badminton%20Environment) published at *AAAI-24 Student Abstract and Demo, DSAI4Sports @ KDD 2023* is a reinforcement learning (RL) environment tailored for AI-driven sports analytics, offering:  i) Realistic opponent simulation for RL training; ii) Visualizations for evaluation; and iii) Performance benchmarks for assessing agent capabilities.
9. [RallyNet](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects/tree/main/RallyNet) published at *ECML PKDD-24* proposes to imitate turn-based player behaviors from experimental contexts and Brownian Motion.
